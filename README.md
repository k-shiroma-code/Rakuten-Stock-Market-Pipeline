# Enhanced Weather Data Pipeline with Apache Airflow

A **production-ready, modular data pipeline** for extracting, processing, and storing weather data using **Apache Airflow, MinIO, Docker**, and **comprehensive monitoring**. Built following **enterprise data engineering best practices**.

## Project Evolution

**Background**: I initially completed a Udemy course on Apache Airflow using a stock market API (Rakuten) with timezone adjustments for DAG scheduling. While functional, I wanted to create a more comprehensive pipeline that demonstrates enterprise-level data engineering practices. This weather data pipeline represents a significant expansion of those foundational concepts.

The `airflow_8/` folder contains the original stock market pipeline logic (Airflow 2.0), serving as a reference for the learning progression from basic ETL to production-ready data architecture.
