# Great â€” sounds like you're working on a **Data Engineering (DE) project**, and based on your message, you've got some containers running:

* `postgres-1` (PostgreSQL)
* `airflow-webserver-1`
* `airflow-scheduler-1`

This suggests you're building a pipeline using **Apache Airflow** and **PostgreSQL**, which is a solid setup. To help guide your **next steps**, here's a typical DE project flow. Letâ€™s figure out where you are and what you should do next.

---

### ðŸ”„ DE Project Flow (Typical Stages)

1. **Set Up Infrastructure** âœ… *(Looks like youâ€™re mostly here)*

   * [x] Docker containers running (Postgres, Airflow)
   * [ ] Confirm Airflow is accessible at `localhost:8080`
   * [ ] Create connections in Airflow (e.g. to Postgres or external sources)

2. **Ingest Data**

   * Source: Where is your data coming from?

     * Public API? CSV file? S3? Web scraping?
   * Ingestion Method:

     * Write a Python script or Airflow DAG to pull data and load into Postgres (staging table)

3. **Transform Data**

   * Clean, normalize, and transform raw data using:

     * SQL scripts in Airflow
     * Python with pandas
     * dbt (optional)

4. **Store/Load**

   * Move transformed data to final tables in Postgres (or another DB, e.g., warehouse like Snowflake or BigQuery)

5. **Schedule and Orchestrate**

   * Use Airflow DAGs to automate the pipeline:

     * Task 1: Ingest
     * Task 2: Transform
     * Task 3: Load

6. **(Optional) Visualization / Reporting**

   * Connect your DB to tools like Metabase, Superset, or Tableau

### ðŸ§­ Whatâ€™s Next for You?

Since you have Postgres and Airflow containers running, ask yourself:

**Q1: Do you have a data source picked out yet?**

* If **no**, I can suggest one (CSV, API, etc.).
* If **yes**, you should:

  * Write an ingestion script or Airflow DAG to load it into Postgres.

**Q2: Is Airflow accessible in your browser?**

* Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
* If not working, let me know what errors you see.

**Q3: Want help writing your first Airflow DAG?**

* I can walk you through building a simple DAG to extract and load data.

---

Tell me:

* What is your data source? (CSV? API? Something else?)
* Do you want help with ingestion, transformation, or scheduling next?

Once I know that, Iâ€™ll give you specific code/DAGs to move forward.
